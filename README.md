Noot Noot. üêß

## /whatis

This was a random idea I had while attending [33C3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress). This combines Tux, the mascot of Linux, with *Pingu*s iconic "nooting" mouth.

## But why?

Because **Noot Noot**. For research purposes, watch some [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=noot+noot) videos starring *Pingu*.

## Can I haz Lizens?

### Tux

According to [Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tux.png), the Tux image is licensed as

```
The copyright holder of this file allows anyone to use it for any purpose, provided that you acknowledge lewing@isc.tamu.edu and The GIMP if someone asks.
```
Well, there you go.

### Pingu

Regarding *Pingu*s Mouth/Nose: I don't know. It's just a red tube. I guess that's not violating any license out there. Same applies to `Noot`. But hey, if you are the copyright holder of either the red nose-mouth-tube or the word `Noot`, send me an e-mail and I'll take this repo down.

### Font

The font is named `Feast of Flesh BB` (pretty name huh?). The included `info.txt` states that it's free to use for non-commercial use. However, their [license page](http://www.blambot.com/license.shtml) is *404ing*. To be honest, I don't know if that changes anything. I'm not a lawyer. In any case, you are safe if you don't sell it...

### The whole image combined

That's my part, I guess. Well, do whatever you want. Print it, remix it, sell it, get tattoos with it. If you really appreciate it, attribute me. If you *really really* appreciate it, buy me a [Club Mate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club-Mate) or something similar if we ever meet.

**TL;DR**: Enjoy.

## File Formats pl0x

* [linootx-big.png](linootx-big.png), if you just need it slightly larger.
* [linootx.svg](linootx.svg). I guess this XML is pretty fucked up, as I exported it with `Adobe Illustrator CS6`.
